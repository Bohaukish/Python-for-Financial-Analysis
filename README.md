## Tine Series with statsmodel.tsa

- ETS(Error-Trend-Seasonality) Decomposition:  
  
  build an understanding of its behaviour; a time series dataset will be broken down into several terms: an error term, a trend term and a seasonality term.

- EWMA(Expoentially Weighted Moving Averages) Model:

  describe some trend level behavior of a time series; better than SMA(simple moving averages) cuz it gives more weights to nearest dates.

- ACF and PACF

- ARIMA
